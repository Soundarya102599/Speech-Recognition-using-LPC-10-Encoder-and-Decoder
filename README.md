# Speech-Recognition-using-LPC-10-Encoder-and-Decoder
Linear Predictive Coding is an analysis and synthesis technique to lossy speech compression that attempts to model the human production of sound instead of transmitting an estimate of the sound wave. Linear predictive coding encoders break up a sound signal into different segments and then send information on each segment to the decoder. The encoder send information on whether the segment is voiced or unvoiced and the pitch period for voiced segment which is used to create an excitement signal in the decoder. The encoder also sends information about the vocal tract which is used to build a filter on the decoder side which when given the excitement signal as input can reproduce the original speech.
